Running the application:

1. Ensure the backend server is running before running the frontend application.

2. Ensure that Node and npm is installed in the system.

3. Navigate to the folder '/code/trunk/job_advert_system/frontend' in the terminal, run the command: 'npm install' (If the command fails, use npm install --force).
This will generate a folder 'node_modules' at the root level of frontend folder.

4. Now run the command: 'npm run start'. The application should automatically start running at: http://localhost:3000
(This can be time-consuming for the first time)


Running tests:

1. Navigate to the folder '/code/trunk/job_advert_system/frontend' in the terminal.

2. Run the command: 'npm run test'. This will run all the unit tests and generate their coverage in the frontend.
(This can be time-consuming for the first time)

3. A folder named 'coverage' will be created at the root level of the frontend folder.
